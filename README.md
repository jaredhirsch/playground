### What

you know that thing where you fuck around with a new library in a random file named "blahfoo"? that, punctuated with microcommits to remind me later what I was thinking.

### Why

because $HOME is a terrible place to keep stuff

### Caveat lector

I doubt this could be useful to anyone--possibly not even me. it's an experiment in recording the ebb and flow of thought.

If I do it right, this might turn out to be raw material for blog posts.

### License

Apache 2 == the best non-copyleft, patent troll repelling open source license around :-)

### brought to you by
